Project 1 - Determining the Likelihood of RCB winning a game of Cricket in the IPL

We look to identify variables that explain the variation in the outcome of RCBâ€™s matches. We make use of the IPL dataset from Kaggle with data on 636 matches to do so. We employ several methods to achieve this goal. We first begin by performing a univariate analysis to identify individual predictors that we think maybe of importance. We fit a logistic regression model to our data to assess which factors best explain win probabilities. We convert our wins into counts to check if the same factors are statistically significant. Our analysis yields interesting insights about the importance of inclusion of variables like the identity of the umpire of the game.
