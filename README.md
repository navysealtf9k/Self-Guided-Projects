### Project 1 - Determining the Likelihood of RCB winning a game of Cricket in the IPL

In this project I seek to identify variables that explain the variation in the outcome of RCBâ€™s matches. I make use of the IPL dataset from Kaggle with data on 636 matches to do so. I begin by performing univariate analysis of the variables in the dataset to identify individual predictors that may be of importance. 

Next, I fit a logistic regression model to the data set to assess which factors best explain win probabilities. I convert wins into counts to check if the same factors are statistically significant. My analysis yields interesting insights about the effects of variables like the identity of the umpire of a game, on the probaibility of RCB winning a game.
